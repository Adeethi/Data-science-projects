# Data Science Projects (2025)  

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects (2025)** repository! This repository contains various data science topics I have worked on throughout the year. Each folder represents a specific area of data science that I have explored.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- Each folder corresponds to a different **data science topic** I have worked on.  
- Inside each folder, you will find **Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb)** that contain my analysis, visualizations, and insights.  
- The projects are based on **various datasets**, covering multiple domains and problem statements.  

## 📊 Topics Covered  
This repository includes projects on:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Machine Learning Models**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- **Feature Engineering**  
- **Time Series Analysis**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Neural Networks**  
- **Data Visualization**  

## 📝 Datasets  
I have worked on multiple datasets from different sources, applying data science techniques to derive meaningful insights and build predictive models.
